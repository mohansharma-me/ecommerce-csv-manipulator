Project aims at enabling eCommerce sellers to generate appropriate CSV to upload their products details to different eCommerce sites like flipkart, snapdeal etcâ€¦ Basically it manipulates csv at backend.

I developed this software while working at WebcodeZ Infoway. It is very simple software intended to manipulate csv for sellers who submit their product details regularly to different ecommerce platform.

Take a look on source code at http://github.com/mohansharma-me/ecommerce-csv-manipulator.

Technologies : C# .NET, SQLite, CSV Lib
